FEM Solver &mdash; Finite Elementh Method PDE Solver
====================================================

This program is a simple solver employing the [Finite Element Method (FEM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) to solve certain families of second order linear PDE boundary value problems with mixed conditions.

It is implemented in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) using [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/).
